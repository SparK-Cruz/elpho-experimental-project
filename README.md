### Experimental Project

This project is used to test the latest features of the elpho framework.
Current synch is with branch [`feature/namespaces`](https://github.com/SparK-Cruz/elpho/tree/feature/namespaces).

This project uses:

* MVC module
* Dependency Injector feature
* Annotation Routing feature
* Namespaces and psr-4 autoloader

The goal of this project is to document by example the new features targeted at the next version.
If you wanna contribute with feature request or pull requests please fork any branch of the project at [this repository](https://github.com/SparK-Cruz/elpho).

Any questions you can find me at `##php` and `##php-br` at the [freenode IRC servers](http://freenode.net/) or mail me at spark.crz(at)gmail.com
